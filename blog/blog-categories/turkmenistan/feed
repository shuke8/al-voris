<h4><strong>Why Should Turkmenistan Be Your Next Destination?</strong></h4>



<p><em>“How wonderful it would be to live
life on a Visa, Travelling across seas and continents without, exploring unseen
lands and revisiting their stories.”</em></p>



<p>Many of us wonder this but only a few
dare to live their dreams. However, whether you have the travel bug in you or
not, <a href="https://ea-travel.uz/turkmenistan-tour-packages"><strong>Turkmenistan Tours</strong></a> must be on your next travel bucket list this year. </p>



<p>The country carries the historical
burden of wars and natural disasters. Despite this Turkmenistan has evolved
into a modernized country and has undergone a great transformation in terms of
infrastructure and economic development. <a href="https://ea-travel.uz/ashgabat"><strong>Ashgabat City</strong> </a>&nbsp;has turned into a mini Dubai and you will feel
more at home and less alienated here. </p>



<p>However, this doesn’t mean the country has lost its historic touch. The rich culture has been restored for various generations. The uniqueness of the country coupled with its rich aesthetics makes it a destination worth visiting. While planning your trip to this exclusive country, here are six things you must know about your travel visa. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16-077-1024x616.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-282" srcset="https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16-077-1024x616.jpg 1024w, https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16-077-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16-077-768x462.jpg 768w, https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16-077.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ol><li><strong>Turkmenistan
Visa Policy And Requirements</strong></li></ol>



<p><em>“So your next Stop is Turkmenistan? The thing you need the
most is your Travel Visa!”</em></p>



<p>A <a href="https://ea-travel.uz/turkmenistan-visa"><strong>Turkmenistan Visa</strong></a> is required by all travelers planning to transit the
country. Visa exclusion policy is only for travelers with special visa permits or
is from certain parts of Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. A Turkmenistan
Tourist Visa can be obtained by any foreign national by supplying an invitation
letter issued by <strong>AlVoris Travels</strong>
which is a licensed travel agency based in Turkmenistan.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Do
you have the Letter of Invitation?</strong></li></ul>



<p><em>“In Turkmenistan, You can’t visit uninvited!”</em></p>



<p>Apart from filling the Turkmenistan
Visa Application, you need to obtain a letter of invitation as Turkmenistan
is the strictest country in Central Asia. You can obtain this letter directly from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan or a registered travel agency
like AlVoris Travels. </p>



<p>Apart from this, you can acquire a transit visa. It may take
up to 6 weeks along with some copies of your visas for Iran or Azerbaijan and
Uzbekistan. </p>



<ul><li><strong>How
to get a Turkmenistan Visa?</strong></li></ul>



<p><em>“Don’t get caught up in details, let AlVoris Travels Guide
you in your Turkmenistan Visa Application”</em></p>



<p>After obtaining the Letter of
Invitation for your Turkmenistan Tours you
can apply for a <a href="https://ea-travel.uz/turkmenistan-visa"><strong>Turkmenistan Visa</strong></a>, either through a visa company or at the local embassy.
The following are the various visa-related information that will come in handy
on your trek:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Visa on arrival</strong></li></ul>



<p>In case you can’t get a Turkmenistan
E-visa you can apply for a Turkmenistan Visa On Arrival at the airport. It is
important to know that you will still require a Letter of Invitation to obtain
a visa on arrival and the visa is can be obtained in USD cash only. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Applying for a visa in advance</strong></li></ul>



<p>Before your Turkmenistan Tours, it is recommended that you obtain
a Turkmenistan visa in advance. Upon arrival through overseas travel, you will
enter the country through the Caspian Sea from Azerbaijan, and arrive at the
port of Turkmenbashi. You won’t be able to obtain a visa on arrival here.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Registering your visa</strong></li></ul>



<p>You must register your visa within 3 days of entering
Turkmenistan. AlVoris Travels’ tour leader will help you with this. It is
requested to carry 2 passport photos for the registration process. The usual Turkmenistan Visa Processing Time is 10 business
days. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Turkmenistan Visa Fee</strong></li></ul>



<p>For Single entry Turkmenistan
Visa Fee for 10 days, the cost of the visa is $35-$55. Multiple entry
visas cost $75-$100 for a month. Transit visas cost $35-$55. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Turkmenistan
Visa For Australian, New Zealand, South African Citizens</strong></li></ul>



<p><em>“Nothing should stop you from traveling!”</em></p>



<p>Before your <a href="https://ea-travel.uz/turkmenistan-tour-packages"><strong>Turkmenistan Tours</strong></a>, you should know that there are no
Turkmenistan embassies in Australia, New Zealand, or South African. To obtain a
Turkmenistan visa you will have to post your passport to the UK or the USA
which is not ideal. For such conditions, you must obtain a visa on arrival at
the airport in Turkmenistan. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Turkmenistan

visa. The address of the embassy has been mentioned below:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tourism.gov.tm/"><strong>Turkmenistan Tourism Board</strong></a> has recently attended the high-level regional meeting titled &#8220;Road to Recovery&#8221; via a video link organized by UNWTO. This high-level event was held in two-panel discussions in which the first panel discussed measures to support the travel and tourism sector and mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 while the second panel focused on best practices and effective strategies for recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>According to Turkmenistan Tourism Statistics provided by <a href="https://www.unwto.org/"><strong>UNWTO</strong></a>, the decline
in international tourism for the rest of 2020 could translate to $910 billion
to $1.2 trillion in lost revenue for the industry. This is a huge setback in
the global economy and tourism industry which has faced a big blow due to the
COVID-19 crisis. People must trust the Turkmenistan Tourism&nbsp;Company which they choose to travel to the
country that provides them the complete guarantee of safety. This is where <strong>AlVoris Travels</strong> comes into action. </p>
