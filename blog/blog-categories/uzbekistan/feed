Road route between China and Europe for more than 2000 years ago and attracts
thousands of travelers every year on <strong>Uzbekistan
Tourism</strong>. </p>



<h4><strong>The
Magnificent Registan In Samarkand</strong></h4>



<p>As <strong>Samarkand city </strong>was the capital of the Empire of Tamerlane and Timurid dynasty in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, Tamerlane and his son Mirzo Ulugbek and other descendant converted the “Registan” into a city center of Samarkand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Magnificent-Registan-1024x616.jpg" alt="The-Magnificent-Registan" class="wp-image-323" srcset="https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Magnificent-Registan-1024x616.jpg 1024w, https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Magnificent-Registan-300x181.jpg 300w, https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Magnificent-Registan-768x462.jpg 768w, https://ea-travel.uz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Magnificent-Registan.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>  <strong>The Magnificent Registan In Samarkand</strong> </figcaption></figure>
